### How to Create the Character Stack

I'm writing this as a note to self because I wish that Past Me had recorded the process he used to generate a stack of nicely-formatted sheets. Now FUTURE Me will hopefully have less of a headache than Present Me is as I try and create a new one from scratch!

First start a new Word Docx file, brand new and blank.

Next, Generate characters via [this website](http://character.totalpartykill.ca/lotfp/) - use Chromium or Cent or such, because it pastes a LOT better from there than it does on Firefox.

Keep refreshing to get new characters each time!

Then drag select + copy + paste the character chunk into a new page on the Word doc.

Select from Equipment to the end of that sheet and apply a two-column format on that part, as it makes it a lot neater and condenses it to a single page.

I also give everyone a standard 5 rations, instead of the random amount there already.

Ctrl+Enter inserts a page break, repeat the copy paste again with a new character.

This results in a single document with as many characters as you need.
