*Ahhhhh... Fresh Meat!*

## About this Document

This document is the beginning of my attempt to write a full HAMMERCRAWL! game system from the ground up. This is very much a work in progress.

### Future Plans

The intended result will be a recognizable OSR game with inspirations from *Dark Dungeons*, *The Nightmares Underneath*, and *Dungeon Crawl Classics*.

### Acknowledgements

HAMMERCRAWL! in this "complete game" format would not exist without the amazing creativity contained in the followed pre-existing games:

* [Dark Dungeons](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177410/Dark-Dungeons) by Blacky the Blackball
* [Dungeon Crawl Classics](http://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/) by Goodman Games
* [The Nightmares Underneath](https://redboxvancouver.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/the-nightmares-underneath-rpg/) by Red Box Vancouver

Seriously, you should probably just go play those instead, they're much better games with much better production values.

### Cost, License, and Contributions

HAMMERCRAWL! is now and always will be a free game. Very few (if any) of these concepts are original to me, and asking for money for the project would just be wrong.

Contributions to testing and development are always welcome.

# About HAMMERCRAWL!

HAMMERCRAWL! is a fantasy dungeon-crawling role-playing game entirely derived from a half-dozen other similar games which were themselves built up from house rules for the older variants of "That One Game" (henceforth just referred to as The OG) that everyone knows. HAMMERCRAWL! doesn't try to do anything new or revolutionary, instead focusing on establishing a familiar-feeling baseline for 100% procedurally-generated tournament-style role-playing. It sands down a lot of the rough points, standardizes a number of odd inconsistencies, and sacrifices more than one established sacred idol of The OG in order to make the game a bit more approachable by noobs and randos that may plop down to play at a public tourney.

This text won't try to introduce you to the hobby or explain the ideas of role-playing to a novice reader of the genre. If this is your first introduction to a game text, good god, Lemon, I hope you enjoy reading but a lot of the text may be confusing. Good luck, and god speed.

## The Basics of Play

HAMMERCRAWL! is an old-school dungeon crawl based game. One of you will take on the role of the Hammersmith (aka Dungeon Master, Game Master, Judge, or whatever you like), and guide the proceedings. The rest of you will take on the roles of Players, and in turn guide Adventurers through a deathtrap meat-grinder of a dungeon that the Hammersmith describes for you.

**Player Roles and Expectations:**

* Role-play the character you have created (or drawn).
* Create Story by describing your Adventurer's actions, motivations, successes, and failures.
* Go into the Dungeons described by the Hammersmith
* Lead your Adventurer forth to Get Rich or Die Trying

**Hammersmith Roles and Expectations:**

* Arrange and master tools for spontaneous creation of play.
* Improvise description of the world around the Adventurers, and the actions it takes against and in response to them.
* Create Story by describing the dungeon environments that the Adventurers explore, and the perils and treasures that they encounter within.
* Enhance the world with Non-Player Characters and other interesting denizens.

Both the Hammersmith and the Players will work together to feed a group of Adventurers to a dungeon, and see who survives. Inside the dungeon, the heroes will encounter wicked monsters, insidious traps, maddening mazes, and hopefully gobs of amazing treasures. Those that fight bravely and/or wisely may just have what it takes to make it out of the dungeon, return to town, and level up to greater tiers of personal power and glory.


## Established Systemic Conventions

If you're familiar with The OG and its many derivatives, the following should probably make sense to you. HAMMERCRAWL! is built with the following system assumptions:

* **Roll High:** The system is tooled around all D20 rolls being targeted high. 20 is good, 1 is bad.
* **Stat Rolls:** Class is determined first, then 3D6 stats in order, with highest two determined by the class.
* **Race as Class:** Races are implemented as entirely separate character classes.
* **Skills:** In addition to expectations based on class abilities and career backgrounds, every character gets 4 random skills they are somehow good at as well.
* **Feats:** There are no "Feats" in this game, at least as codified by other derivatives of The OG.
* **Armor Class:** Base 10, Ascending.
* **Combat Initiative:** Side-based, then ordered by a five-step flow based on type of action (Move, Missile, Melee, Misc, Magic)
* **Damage:** Weapon damage is based on the Hit Die of the character using the weapon.
* **Experience Levels:** 15 levels for all characters. Each level requires Level x 1000 XP to attain, and every time you gain a level your XP reserve is reduced to zero.
* **Experience Points:** XP is gained from overcoming challenges and from investing treasure.
* **XP as Money:** XP is the fifth and final new step on the Classic Money Chain (CP, SP, GP, PP, and now XP), with 10 PP = 1XP.
* **Advantages and Disadvantages:** They're in here, and they're incremental.

# Book One: The Player's Guide to Crawling Dungeons

## CHAPTER: Creating Your Character

You will need the following for this process:

* A printed character sheet or other such notepad
* A writing utensil
* A full set of gaming dice

##### Sidebar: The Online Generation Method

I strongly recommend using [my companion random character generator program](https://github.com/nonplayer/OldSchoolCharGen) for this process. It allows entire stacks of characters to be generated with a few keystrokes. Hammersmiths can thus create a single pile of replacement characters for instant access and insertion into an ongoing dungeon, saving time in longer play sessions with high death tolls.

### Step 1: Roll Your Class

First and foremost, you must randomly determine your new character's Class. Roll 2d6, and then consult the following table:

| Roll  | Class             |
|-------|-------------------|
| 2-3   | Elf Exemplar      |
| 4-7   | Dwarf Defender    |
| 8-12  | Human*            |
| 13-16 | Halfling Burglar  |
| 17-18 | Halforc Berserker |

*If human, roll 1d4 to determine your actual class:

1. Cleric
2. Fighter
3. Magic-User
4. Thief

**Note:** These tables are for a primarily humanocentric fantasy setting, such as that established in The OG. Adjust these as needed for your campaign setting.


### Step 2: Record your Class Data

Each class has its own special rules and abilities. Take note of yours using the references below.


#### TEMPLATE

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:**
  - **Decent:**
  - **Bad:**

**Special Ability:** Blah

**Special Ability:** Blah

**Special Ability:** Blah

#### Dwarf Defender

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:**
  - **Decent:**
  - **Bad:**

**Born in Armor:** Dwarves in Medium or heavier armour do not suffer AC penalties from low DEX mods. Heavy armour never reduces their movement speed.

**Born of Earth and Stone:** Dwarves are never lost when underground with solid earth or stone beneath their feet. They know the local grades and depth, and can feel air flow naturally. They have a 50% chance of detecting hidden stonework just by passing, and automatically find it if they spend a turn searching.

**Dwarf Battlemaster:** Dwarves have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, a Dwarf declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Dwarven Resilience:** Dwarves have advantage on all of their Good saves.

**Shield Brothers:** Dwarves can use a Shield Bash with any one of their successful attack dice. Additionally, dwarves do not lose the AC bonus of their shield when using the bash.

#### Elf Exemplar

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:**
  - **Decent:**
  - **Bad:**

**Ageless Perfection:** Elves are immune to sleep, charm, slow, haste, aging, and energy drain effects, *unless* those effects are results of the magic of an Elf (self or other, alive or undead).

**Blade Dancer:** Elves have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 5, 10, and 15. When attacking, an Elf declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Keen Awareness:** Elves are spatially aware of their surroundings at all time. They have a 50% chance of noticing concealed *non-stonework* doors and panels simply by passing near them, and automatically find them if they spend a turn searching.

#### Halfling Burglar

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:** ???
  - **Decent:** ???
  - **Bad:** ???

**Backup Thief:** Halflings can function as thieves of a sort, in a pinch.

**Often Overlooked:** Unless their actions indicate them to be an obvious threat, or their opponents are otherwise specifically predisposed against them, a halfling is always attacked last.

#### Halforc Berserker

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - Good: add your level to your roll.
  - Okay: add 1/2 your level (round down) to the roll.
  - Bad: add 1/3 your level (round down) to the roll.

#### Human Cleric

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:**
  - **Decent:**
  - **Bad:**

#### Human Fighter

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:**
  - **Decent:**
  - **Bad:**

**Combat Superiority:** Fighters have a bonus attack die at first level (giving them two), and gain a new one at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. When attacking, a Fighter declares their target(s) and then rolls all of their attack dice, but only one damage die. Each attack that hits applies the same amount of damage.

**Shield-Trainer:** Fighters can use a Shield Bash with any one of their successful attack dice.

#### Human Magic-User

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:**
  - **Decent:**
  - **Bad:**

#### Human Thief

* **Hit Dice:**
* **Attack Rank:**
* **Saving Throws:**
  - **Good:**
  - **Decent:**
  - **Bad:**

**Stabbity!:** When a Thief is using a melee weapon to attack a foe against which the Thief either has attack advantage or is hidden from perception, the thief doubles their damage against that foe on a successful hit. This multiple increases by +1 at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.

**Thief Skills:** Thieves have access to a special array of professional skills which can allow them special unique methods to assess and even bypass dangers. These are: Deciphering, Lockpicking, Perception, Stealth, Thief-climbing, Tracking, Trap-finding, and Trap-breaking. The Thief adds their level to rolls using these skills.

At first level the Thief must randomly determine one Thief Skill to be their Bailiwick, and one to be their Failing. The thief gets advantage on checks related to their Bailiwick, and disadvantage on checks related to their Failing.

### Step 3: Roll Your Stats

Now roll 3d6 six times, and write them down in order.

*Example: Darla rolls 3d6 six times and writes them down in the order she rolled them: 9, 14, 11, 10, 5, and 17.*

**First** assign your highest rolls *in order of their rolling* to the Prime Stats of your character class. Most classes should have two Prime Stats, some only one, and maybe others three. However many, take the highest rolls from your set in the order they were rolled, and assign them to the Prime Stats in the order they appear on the character sheet.

*Example: Since Darla rolled a Fighter in the first step, she notes that her class's Prime Stats are STR and CON. Darla's highest-rolled stats are 14 and 17. Assigning them in the order rolled, she notes that her new Fighter now has a STR of 14 and a CON of 17.*

**Next** assign the remaining rolls *in order of their rolling* to the remaining empty stats on your character sheet.

*Example: Darla's remaining rolls are 9, 11, 10, and 5. She assigns them in order to her Fighter's remaining stats, which results in a final spread of: STR 14, DEX 9, CON 17, INT 11, WIS 10, CHA 5.*


### Step X: Roll Your Skills

While your character is assumed to have many unwritten skills simply through their class and background, you also begin the game with four randomly determined skills that you somehow picked up during your pre-game life. Explanations for these are up to you.



These are all you get. You will not automatically acquire more skills unless the Hammersmith and/or the whims of the game otherwise gift them to you.

### Party Actions

#### Party Action 1: Camping

#### Party Action 3: Returning to Town

### Saving Throws

You will frequently be asked to make a "saving throw" in order to resist affects from spells, traps, and many other dangers. The Hammersmith will tell you when you need to make a Save, and which of the following five categories that save falls under:

* Area Attacks
* Death Effects
* Mind Debilitation
* Body Debilitation
* Fate and Fortune

When it's time to make the check, roll 1d20 and add your relevant modifier based on your class and stats. The target number for your roll is based on the "Tier" of power of the source effect, determined by comparing the source's relevant power tier to your character's current experience tier:

| Source Tier is…    | Target |
|--------------------|--------|
| Two or more Lower  | 6      |
| One Lower          | 9      |
| Equal              | 12     |
| One Higher         | 15     |
| Two or more Higher | 18     |

For example, a 2nd level Adventurer (Tier 1) saving against the magical fear effect of a 7th level Monster (Tier 3) would have to roll an 18 or higher, due to the differences in their tiers.



### Skills

All characters in HAMMERCRAWL! begin play with a variety of both explicit and assumed skills. Explicit skills include the four free random skills that each character gets at creation. Assumed skills are anything that one could reasonably assume the character has ability in due to their background and their class. Fighters and Elves are pretty athletic, obviously, while former Bankers and Accountants are assumed to know math and finances.

The Hammersmith is heavily encouraged to involve these skills as ways to move things along and give out information without relying upon the dice. The *vast* majority of the time, skills should be involved in play as purely narrative flavor. If a Banker is looking over a found ledger of an evil kingdom's accounts, they do not need to roll for anything, and the Hammersmith will give them special information that only they can glean from it. Similarly, a physically fit Elf adventurer should not need to make a check to climb a tree, leap a fence, or rappel down a ravine with proper tooling. In most cases, the 'Smith is encouraged to simply "give it to them" when they clearly have the right skill or assumed background for the situation.

Still, the Hammersmith may *occasionally* feel that a roll of some sort should still be somehow involved, for behind the scenes reasons. Perhaps the aforementioned ledger is encoded in a strange cryptic cypher, or maybe the Elf is trying to climb that tree in the middle of an earthquake!

In such cases, the Hammersmith may call for a test. The player will need to roll a d20 and add the modifier of whichever stat the 'Smith deems most appropriate. If the character has either an explicit or assumed skill in the matter, their target is 10. If not, their target is 15. And if it's something that the 'Smith deems to be vastly out of that character's repertoire of ability, the target is 20.

Thief skills are special, and detailed in the "Thief Skills" section.

### Thief Skills (ref)

Thieves (and to a lesser extent Halflings) have access to special skills which always require rolls.

### Tiers

A number of effects in the game use the "Tier" mechanic as a rough relative comparison of power between two or more entities within the fiction. For example, gaining XP from challenges is determined by the relative tiers of the Party and their Opponents, and similarly the targets for Saving Throws against harmful effects are based on Tier comparison.

| Tier | XP/HD Levels | Adventurer Rank         | Monster Rank    | Treasure?          |
|------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 1-3          | Skilled Vagabond        | Nuisance        | Money              |
| 2    | 4-6          | Professional Adventurer | Monster         | Gem/Art            |
| 3    | 7-9          | Local Hero              | Serious Danger  | Minor Magic Item   |
| 4    | 10-12        | Reknowned Hero          | Critical Threat | Major Magic Item   |
| 5    | 13-15        | Living Legend           | Legendary Foe   | Legendary Artifact |
| 6    | 16+          | N/A                     | Ultimate Threat | Divine Relic       |

Note that player characters' levels are capped at 15, and as such an adventurer's personal experience Tier will never rise above 5. Monsters and Treasures have one tier higher, because there is always something more powerful than even the greatest of heroes...

Dungeon levels have tiers too! Treat the level of the Dungeon as its own Tier, directly. Thus the first level is Tier 1, the second is Tier 2, the third is Tier 3, and so on.

### Timekeeping


## CHAPTER: Combat and Fighting


### Combat Stats and Details


### Combat Process

1. Check for Surprise
2. COMBAT ROUNDS
  * Roll Initiative to determine first action.
  * COMBAT TURN
    - Resolve Movement Actions
    - Resolve Missile Actions
    - Resolve Melee Actions
    - Resolve Misc. Actions
    - Resolve Magic Actions
  * Still Fighting? Back to Initiative!
3. LOOT TIME!

#### Surprise

#### Combat Rounds

A combat round is roughly ten (10) seconds of action.

#### Initiative

At the top of each Round of combat, the designated leader of each side rolls initiative as follows: 1d10 + DEX mod + WIS mod. Highest roll wins initiative. Initiative Ties are resolved in the following order of determination:

1. Most numerous side wins
2. Winner of last initiative wins
3. Roll off

After Initiative is determined, the winning side gets to take all of their actions first, followed by the losing side. Each side must take their actions in the following order, every time:

1. Movement: People who are only moving go first.
2. Missile: People firing ranged weapons go second.
3. Melee: People making melee attacks go third.
4. Misc.: People taking "miscellaneous" actions go fourth.
5. Magic: People using magic spells and attacks go last.

The Hammersmith resolves this by announcing which "phase" of action is now, and resolving the actions of any characters who are acting in that phase. Players can choose to wait to declare their actions until their chosen phase is announced. Actions are declared and resolved at the same time.

#### Movement Actions

#### Missile Actions

#### Melee Actions

##### Special: Shield Bash

The shield bash is a special attack available to Dwarves and Fighters.

blah

Fighters who Shield Bash as one of their attack dice lose the shield's AC bonus until their next combat turn. Dwarves do not suffer this setback.

#### Misc. Actions

#### Loot Time!

When combat ends, the survivors gain the might-gained right to loot the bodies of the fallen, both foe and friend alike. This is a divine privilege that extends back to the earliest days of gaming, and is in fact the reason many of us still play these elf games today. Loot gained through feats of martial and magical prowess is the best loot, bar none.
