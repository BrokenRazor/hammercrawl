*Ahhhhh... Fresh Meat!*

## About this Document

This document is the beginning of my attempt to write a full HAMMERCRAWL! game system from the ground up. This is very much a work in progress.

### Future Plans

The intended result will be a recognizable OSR game with inspirations from *Dark Dungeons*, *The Nightmares Underneath*, and *Dungeon Crawl Classics*.

### Cost, License, and Contributions

HAMMERCRAWL! is now and always will be a free game. Very few (if any) of these concepts are original to me, and asking for money for the project would just be wrong.

Contributions to testing and development are always welcome.

# About HAMMERCRAWL!

HAMMERCRAWL! is a fantasy dungeon-crawling role-playing game entirely derived from a half-dozen other similar games which were themselves built up from house rules for the older variants of "That One Game" (henceforth just referred to as The OG) that everyone knows. HAMMERCRAWL! doesn't try to do anything new or revolutionary, instead focusing on establishing a familiar-feeling baseline for 100% procedurally-generated tournament-style role-playing. It sands down a lot of the rough points, standardizes a number of odd inconsistencies, and sacrifices more than one established sacred idol of The OG in order to make the game a bit more approachable by noobs and randos that may plop down to play at a public tourney.

This text won't try to introduce you to the hobby or explain the ideas of role-playing to a novice reader of the genre. If this is your first introduction to a game text, good god, Lemon, I hope you enjoy reading but a lot of the text may be confusing. Good luck, and god speed.

## The Basics of Play

HAMMERCRAWL! is an old-school dungeon crawl based game. One of you will take on the role of the Hammersmith (aka Dungeon Master, Game Master, Judge, or whatever you like), and guide the proceedings. The rest of you will take on the roles of Players, and in turn guide Adventurers through a deathtrap meat-grinder of a dungeon that the Hammersmith describes for you.

**Player Roles and Expectations:**

* Role-play the character you have created (or drawn).
* Create Story by describing your Adventurer's actions, motivations, successes, and failures.
* Go into the Dungeons described by the Hammersmith
* Lead your Adventurer forth to Get Rich or Die Trying

**Hammersmith Roles and Expectations:**

* Arrange and master tools for spontaneous creation of play.
* Improvise description of the world around the Adventurers, and the actions it takes against and in response to them.
* Create Story by describing the dungeon environments that the Adventurers explore, and the perils and treasures that they encounter within.
* Enhance the world with Non-Player Characters and other interesting denizens.

Both the Hammersmith and the Players will work together to feed a group of Adventurers to a dungeon, and see who survives. Inside the dungeon, the heroes will encounter wicked monsters, insidious traps, maddening mazes, and hopefully gobs of amazing treasures. Those that fight bravely and/or wisely may just have what it takes to make it out of the dungeon, return to town, and level up to greater tiers of personal power and glory.


## Established Systemic Conventions

If you're familiar with The OG and its many derivatives, the following should probably make sense to you. HAMMERCRAWL! is built with the following system assumptions:

* **Stat Rolls:** Class is determined first, then 3D6 stats in order, with highest two determined by the class.
* **Race as Class:** Races are implemented as entirely separate character classes.
* **Skills:** In addition to expectations based on class abilities and career backgrounds, every character gets 4 random skills they are somehow good at as well.
* **Feats:** There are no "Feats" in this game, at least as codified by other derivatives of The OG.
* **Armor Class:** Base 10, Ascending.
* **Combat Initiative:** Side-based, then ordered by a five-step flow based on type of action (Move, Missile, Melee, Misc, Magic)
* **Damage:** Weapon damage is based on the Hit Die of the character using the weapon.
* **Experience Levels:** 15 levels for all characters. Each level requires Level x 1000 XP to attain, and every time you gain a level your XP reserve is reduced to zero.
* **Experience Points:** XP is gained from overcoming challenges and from investing treasure.
* **XP as Money:** XP is the fifth and final new step on the Classic Money Chain (CP, SP, GP, PP, and now XP), with 10 PP = 1XP.

## CHAPTER: Creating Your Character

You will need the following for this process:

* A printed character sheet or other such notepad
* A writing utensil
* A full set of gaming dice

##### Sidebar: The Online Generation Method

I strongly recommend using my companion random character generator program for this process. It allows entire stacks of characters to be generated with a few keystrokes. Hammersmiths can thus create a single pile of replacement characters for instant access and insertion into an ongoing dungeon, saving time in longer play sessions with high death tolls.

### Step 1: Roll Your Class

First and foremost, you must randomly determine your new character's Class. Roll 2d6, and then consult the following table:

| Roll  | Class             |
|-------|-------------------|
| 2-3   | Elf Exemplar      |
| 4-7   | Dwarf Defender    |
| 8-12  | Human*            |
| 13-16 | Halfling Burglar  |
| 17-18 | Halforc Berserker |

*If human, roll 1d4 to determine your actual class:

1. Cleric
2. Fighter
3. Magic-User
4. Thief

**Note:** These tables are for a primarily humanocentric fantasy setting, such as that established in The OG. Adjust these as needed for your campaign setting.


### Step 2: Record your Class Data

Each class has its own special rules and abilities. Take note of yours using the references below.


#### TEMPLATE

* **Hit Dice:**

#### Dwarf Defender

#### Elf Exemplar

#### Halfling Burglar

#### Halforc Berserker

#### Human Cleric

#### Human Fighter

#### Human Magic-User

#### Human Thief



### Step 3: Roll Your Stats

Now roll 3d6 six times, and write them down in order.

*Example: Darla rolls 3d6 six times and writes them down in the order she rolled them: 9, 14, 11, 10, 5, and 17.*

**First** assign your highest rolls *in order of their rolling* to the Prime Stats of your character class. Most classes should have two Prime Stats, some only one, and maybe others three. However many, take the highest rolls from your set in the order they were rolled, and assign them to the Prime Stats in the order they appear on the character sheet.

*Example: Since Darla rolled a Fighter in the first step, she notes that her class's Prime Stats are STR and CON. Darla's highest-rolled stats are 14 and 17. Assigning them in the order rolled, she notes that her new Fighter now has a STR of 14 and a CON of 17.*

**Next** assign the remaining rolls *in order of their rolling* to the remaining empty stats on your character sheet.

*Example: Darla's remaining rolls are 9, 11, 10, and 5. She assigns them in order to her Fighter's remaining stats, which results in a final spread of: STR 14, DEX 9, CON 17, INT 11, WIS 10, CHA 5.*


### Step X: Roll Your Skills

While your character is assumed to have many unwritten skills simply through their class and background, you also begin the game with four randomly determined skills that you somehow picked up during your pre-game life. Explanations for these are up to you.



These are all you get. You will not automatically acquire more skills unless the Hammersmith and/or the whims of the game otherwise gift them to you.
