# WELCOME TO HAMMERCRAWL!

The HAMMERCRAWL! method uses a set of special "Meta-Actions" to completely randomize the creation of the Dungeon that the party is exploring. The core tools used in this are a full set of [Dungeonmorph][] Dice and/or cards, a full set of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd Edition special dice, and an array of mostly-online random generators.

HAMMERCRAWL! is not meant to be a core game system. Instead it is my own custom-compiled home-rules method for running "Old School" dungeon crawl style games with 100% game randomization. Characters, dungeon rooms, encounters, and more - all are generated randomly. It works best with games that favor this kind of dungeon play - I recommend [Dark Dungeons][] of the OSR realm.



# BASIC DM RULES!

This document starts with the DM rules up front, because it is primarily written for DMs.

## THE TOOLS OF HAMMERCRAWL!

### The Dungeon Generators

To generate Dungeon rooms, I use a set of Dungeonmorph dice and their matching blue-and-white cards (the latter kept into handy dry-erase sleeves). They even come with little symbols and a handy key to them, for adding more spontaneous dungeon features on the fly.

The basic process involves going from room to room, encountering obstacles, grabbing treasure, and moving ever onward. When it’s time to move to a new room, I grab one of the dice from a bag, roll it, and that’s the next room. I then find the matching card and lay it out. The pieces are all laid out on the table, and the dungeon grows dynamically as the players explore it.

Conversely, the [Donjon][] site has an extremely detailed set of random dungeon generators. Using them to pre-build your dungeon can save a lot of time at the table for playing.

### The Divining Dice

I use a set of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd Edition dice to serve as a way to "divine" the results of the party's actions. To quickly run through the dice, with WFRP3 you get a mix of seven different types of dice, coded by color: Blue, Yellow, White, Green, Red, Black, and Purple. Each of these colors represents a different purpose, such as Challenge, Luck, Fortune, Skull, and so on. Their different faces have symbols instead of numerical pips, which you can use to divine the outcomes of tests in that game. For this game, the dice translate as:

* **Blue: The Reward Die** - rolled to find new fortunes and treasure.
* **Red: The “Huzzah!” Die** - rolled when the heroes are especially brave and/or foolhardy.
* **Green: The Caution Die** - rolled to reward careful strategy and conversation.
* **White: The Luck Die** - added to the pool for good ideas and plans.
* **Black: The Dark Die** - added when the players’ own actions turn against them.
* **Yellow: The Die of Expertise** - representing solid applied skill and craft.
* **Purple: The Die of Challenge** - Purple dice can bring great danger and peril, but amplify XP! 

Don't have dice of your own? [Use the Broken Tome generator!](http://brokentome.com/tools/DiceRoller.aspx)

### The Generators

* [Donjon][] - more random generators than a human will ever need
* [Totalpartykill][] - fantastic formatted one-click random characters
* [BECMI Utilities][] - an old Windows app for BECMI randomness
* [Behind the Name][] - Best random name tool on the Internet, no contest
* [Warhammer FRP3 Dice Tool][] - in case you don't have the physical dice

### Other Things You Need to Track

I just use a graph paper notebook for these:

* Character list (player names, PC names, classes, AC)
* Dungeon Level Exit Roll Tally
* Death List


## GAME SETUP!

First off, you need some players. I think this process works best with no more than 5.

You then need the basic tools.

Then you need to print off a stack of characters using any of the recommended generators. I suggest a stack of 50, that should last you a few games.

Designate one player character to be the party Leader!

Have the party leader pick the Difficulty Level of the dungeon, from the three options below:

1. Normal: Only a single Purple die is used for the Divining Pool, XP rewards are normal.
2. Hardcore: 2 Purple Dice are used in the Divining Pool, XP rewards are doubled (x2).
3. IRON MAN! 3 Purple Dice are used in the Divining Pool, XP rewards are quintupled (x5)

### Building the Dungeon in Advance

While this does partially-defeat the whole "100% random" approach to play encouraged by this system, I admit that the dungeon can be the trickiest thing to build on the fly, and the most time-consuming. To save on time, pre-designing a dungeon is pretty simple using the random dungeon generators at the [Donjon][]. Hell, it can even pre-plan encounters, saving you the need to roll for the enemy types in your divining pool!


## DUNGEON CRAWLING!

Running the Dungeon is primarily a process of listening and responding. Use the group's Explore Actions to build the Dungeon and randomize its contents. Use their Camp Actions to allow them a brief respite from the dangers that surround them. Finally, use their Town Actions to level them up and let them re-stock their supplies.

What you do outside of all of this is up to you. It IS a role-playing game, after all, so run it otherwise as you would your game of choice!

### Explore Actions

What to do when the players choose a new Explore Action:

#### First build the Dungeon...

When the players choose to move to the next room with an Explore Action, it's time to build the dungeon: **Roll one random Dungeon die!** Then find its matching card and lay it out, or instead just draw it on a new index card.

Regarding room exits, one of the interesting features of the Dungeonmorph dice is that every result comes up with up to eight exits, so as to allow the dice to seamlessly connect and the dungeon to infinitely grow. But sometimes that doesn’t make sense for a random dungeon, especially when trying to give it confines. To fix this, I use a mix of “eyeballing” it and randomly rolling: Roll either 1d8 or 2d4 for each room to determine how many exits are actually there, and then when drawing the room out on the card be sure to leave out the ones that got dropped.

Finally, for each room visited after the starting room, there is a cumulative 1 in 20 chance that one of the exits of the room leads down to the next dungeon level. There is no set limit to how many such exits there are on a level; when one is discovered, the count resets to 1.

#### THEN roll the Divining Pool!

Next, it's time to roll the Divining Pool! This dice pool is built using a mix of regular gaming dice plus the fancy colored dice from WFRP3. **First we build the initial Divining Pool.** Always begin with the following:

* **Standard Blue Die:** Always Start with one Blue Die.
* **Challenge Level:** This is up to the players, chosen at the beginning of the dungeon! Add 1, 2, or 3 Purple dice.
* **Encounter Check Die:** Depends on your method for determining a random encounter. Using Dark Dungeons, this is a single d6, with an encounter occurring on a 1 (see p. 130).
* **Reaction Check Dice:** To determine initial reactions of the encounter. In Dark Dungeons, this is 2D6 (see p. 128-129).
* **Encounter Type Die:** To determine _what_ you encounter. In Dark Dungeons, this is a d20 (see p. 129-130).

Before rolling, add extra Warhammer dice based on the situation:

* **Did they stealthily enter the room?** Add a Green Die.
* **Did they kick in the door and rush the room?** Add a Red Die.
* **Did anyone actually say “Huzzah!” when entering?** Add another Red Die.
* **Did they raise an alarm or otherwise fore-warn the room’s occupants somehow?** Add a Black Die.
* **Are they taking any clever precautions or plans (other than the usual trap-checking)?** Add a White Die for each “really good idea” they have.
* **Do they have any useful tools that might affect the situation?** Add a Yellow Die if they are making active use of special gear, such as maps, potions, etc.
* **Other Mods:** Add more dice based on whim, nefarious plans, the "Scout Ahead" camp action results, cocky player complacency, shifting planes, stock market trends, and whatever else you feel makes sense.

With the Divining Pool complete, it's time to roll! **I highly suggest using a dice tray for this.**

#### Roll Results

The special symbols on the divining dice translate to different aspects of the next room, determined as follows:

**First, the Normal Dice.** These determine if, what, and how you encounter. See respective game rules for these, but in Dark Dungeons which I use, they are on pages 128-130, mostly.

*As for the Warhammer Dice...*

**Hammers and Crossblades!** These cancel each other out one for one. Any remaining adjust the Reaction roll, with Hammers increasing it and Crossblades decreasing it, one for one.

**Hammer-Plus:** (Yellow die only) Some yellow results show a hammer with a plus. That means to add *another* yellow die and immediately roll it, adding its results to the pool.

**Falcons and Skulls!** These cancel each other out one for one. These represent temporary effects the party faces in the immediate room and/or encounter. Net Falcons give the party temporary boons, while net Skulls give them setbacks. These are somewhat free-form, use whatever makes sense. Setbacks tend to be a bit worse than boons, that's just how adventuring works.

*Example Boons:*

* The explore action did not cost them any time or light, hurrah!
* They find the hidden pack of a long lost adventurer and re-up some supplies, hurrah!
* The next room offers them an immediate defensible position and cover, hurrah!

*Example Setbacks:*

* Their active light sources flicker and sputter for whatever reason, removing an extra 1d4 turns of time from their durations.
* One of their maintained spells suddenly fails.
* Another random encounter happened by at the exact same time, oh no!
* One of their rations spoils and must be discarded!

**Blood Drops:** INJURY! When blood drops are rolled (Red dice only), the team suffered damage or stress of some kind in their charge forward. Roll Xd4 damage (X = current dungeon level) and have the team apply it among themselves.

**Hourglasses:** DELAY! When an Hourglass is rolled (Green dice only), the team suffered some form of delay getting to the next room. Knock off an additional 1d4 Turns of game time.

**Comets:** MAGIC! Fortune smiles upon the heroes, as there is a guaranteed magical item in the room, waiting to be discovered! Of course, if there are Skulls in the pool, it could very well be cursed...

**Chaos Stars:** TRAPS! For each Chaos Star, there is a random Trap somewhere in this room, placed as you see fit. If the traps are damaging traps, there is a limit to how much total dice of damage the traps in one room can deal. Each damaging trap deals a number of dice equal to the current level of the dungeon. The size of the die depends on the total number of traps in that dungeon room. If it is the only trap, then it uses d8s. If there are two-to-three traps, they use d6s. If there are *four or more* traps, they use d4s.

##### Random Traps

Chaos Stars bring traps, and to create them I’m using the handy set of generators at the donjon. And if all else fails, there is the 1d20 Tricks and Traps table from the AD&D 1E DMG.

I personally like to pre-roll about 50 traps for each potential dungeon level and then print out the list in advance, just in case I lack an internet connection at my game. Then when a new one is encountered, I start at the top of the list, use the next one, and cross it off when done.

##### Random Monsters

With my current process, I use the Wandering Monsters table from p.129-130 of [Dark Dungeons][]. A single Crossblade means it has basic wandering numbers, two means it has an extra die, and three plus means it is a full-on lair of said creature, when applicable. A bit of common sense is required for working those out on the fly, of course, on a monster by monster basis.

##### Random Treasure

For Random Encounter Treasure, I’m using a Windows program I found ages ago called [BECMI Utilities][]. It generates treasure based on the old Rules Cyclopedia “A-O, P-V” treasure classes, which Dark Dungeons also uses. I’ve made heavy use of these very tables in my own long-running weekend games, and am quite familiar with their typical yields.

Conversely, the [Donjon][] has the same treasure tool available there for AD&D/OSRIC editions (but not B/X and its ilk), if you are running with an internet connection.

### Backtracking

Each time the party moves back through a room they’ve already visited, there is a cumulative 1 in 10 chance that the room has repopulated with enemies and stuff. If that chance occurs, roll a new encounter as normal. Nowhere is truly safe!

### Time-Keeping

This system of gaming requires a strict enforcement of timekeeping in the nature of “turns” of dungeon action. In accordance with classic rules:

* One Turn = Ten Minutes of in-game time
* One Round = Ten Seconds, and thus:
* One Turn = Sixty Rounds, and:
* One Hour = 6 Turns

This is crucial for keeping track of light sources and special short-duration game effects. Some basic notes of importance for the B/X and related rules sets that we use:

* A **Torch** lasts for 1 Hour (6 Turns)
* A **Lantern** lasts for 4 Hours (24 turns) on 1 flask of oil
* **Light spells** last for 6 turns, +1 per caster level
* Each **Explore Action** costs a turn as well. This does not locate any secrets, but does give a full visual description of the room they are entering.
* Each **Combat encounter** lasts a minimum of 1 turn, *regardless* of actual number of rounds. Combats longer than 60 rounds can last more than 1 turn - divide the total number of rounds by 60, rounding up, minimum of 1. That's how many turns it takes.
* **Searching for Secrets** takes one turn per 10×10 area of the room, and uses the Search skill. Characters can split up to search different places simultaneously and save time. For thieves, this will also include searching for traps.


## END GAME REWARDS!

I like to give out prizes for my convention games, based on in-game accomplishments:

* 1st player to get 1000g
* 1st Death by Trap
* 1st Death by Monster
* 1st Death by Other Player / Friendly Fire
* Longest-lived character at the end
* Most (own) Character Deaths
* Most Monster Kills
* FINAL VOTE: Most Valuable Player-driven *Action*
* FINAL VOTE: Most Valuable Player-driven *Cunning Plan*
* FINAL VOTE: Most Hilarious Character Death

These are a work in progress.



# BASIC PLAYER RULES!

As a player, there's not much more that you need to do other than play the game as you normally would. Using the HAMMERCRAWL! method, the only extra player concerns are in the realms of Character Creation, Character Death, and Meta-Game Actions. 

## CHARACTER MANAGEMENT!

### Your First Character

Youngest player at the table draws first! Draw Three characters from the stack, pick one. Put the other two face down on the TOP. Repeat until everyone has one character. The LAST person puts their two rejects on the BOTTOM of the stack.

Newcomer to the table? Draw three, pick one, put the others on the BOTTOM!

Play this character until they die!

### Who is Party Leader?

One character must be responsible for relaying to the DM the party's official plans. With the initial group selected, the players must decide on the starting Leader of their party.

### Your Character's Inevitable Demise

When you die, your gear becomes party loot. Each item has a 50% (use a d6) chance of being made worthless and useless by your death, however!

Draw a new character from the pile! You arrive either one Turn or one Round later, whichever makes more sense or seems more exciting.

If the dead character was party leader, the group needs to elect a new leader! If this is instantaneous, then move on. However if there is any debate or argument on the role, **it takes one turn of game time** - mark off those lights!

### Don't forget Food and Lights!

Before you head off on your trek, you should make special note that Food and Lights are extremely important to survival in the HAMMERCRAWL! experience. Dungeons are dark and scary places, and most characters can't see in the dark. Without light, you can't act, nor can you camp! Similarly, Food is required in order to camp as well. No food? No camp action!

To better keep track of your light sources, I highly recommend making use of the awesome custom [Torch Cards][] from Dyson Logos. There are lanterns there too! They make great tools for tracking the countdown of lights.

### Managing Loot and XP

The characters will gain XP from encounters they defeat, and hopefully loot as well. XP earned from encounters is immediately applied to the character sheet.

Using some traditional old school game rules, monetary loot also counts as XP – but in HAMMERCRAWL!, that XP is only applied *after* the heroes make it back to town with the loot. So when loot is acquired, write down the loot and its value, but do not count it as XP just yet. Heroes can also convert a fraction of the loot to XP as a Camp Action, but this wastes the vast majority of it.


## USING SKILLS!

Skills are handled as one would expect in the base game being played. Since HAMMERCRAWL! is written primarily with "old school" games in mind, this means that the method expects the same kind of old school mentalities to apply when using "skills" in play.

If you are new to this concept, I recommend starting with the ["Quick Primer for Old School Gaming"](http://www.lulu.com/items/volume_63/3019000/3019374/1/print/3019374.pdf) as a good introductory read.

In short, in "old school" style play, the characters are all assumed to be able to do a great number of things that aren't otherwise specifically written on their character sheets, *provided* they have a reasonable amount of time to do so. For just a few examples, given a low-stress situation (as in "not being actively stabbed by murder trees and melted by acid goblins") and appropriate time to accomplish, the following assumptions can be made:

* Fighters and Thieves can climb a wall or barrier with assumed handholds.
* Wizards and Priests can decipher ancient tomes through extended study.
* A character from a woodsman background can tell if a plant is poisonous or not.
* Anyone unencumbered and without clanky bits can walk slowly and silently for a bit.
* ...and so on

Again, these are just some basic examples of assumptions that can be made. When there is a question of complexity and/or added danger, use one or more (or all!) of the following basic guidelines:

##### Is time a factor worth considering in this moment?

If so, let them perform the task without a roll, but let them know it takes one or more turns of time to accomplish. This can diminish light sources and spell durations, and also affect the exploration dice pools!

##### Is there a chance of a dangerous complication?

This includes things such as "they might hurt themselves" or such. If so, incorporate a basic Ability Check (d20 roll-under). Either way they succeed at the task, but with a failed roll they also suffer a setback, such as:

* HP loss (1 to 1d4 points maybe)
* Equipment loss
* Injury or such resulting in Temporary penalty to near-future die rolls
* an added challenge die to the next exploration pool
* alerting nearby enemies
* some other appropriate environmental response

##### Is there a chance of failure?

This one's a tough call, because again, these are supposed to be capable adventurers. If you truly feel that the feat is a tough enough that they might not succeed, first let them know this in your own preferred DM narrative way. Try to encourage them to offer new strategies to overcome the task, fall-back plans, or complete reassessment of the situation.

If they still persist, as above have them roll an associated ability check. With a failed roll, they both fail the task _and_ suffer some complication from above. Sucks, but they knew the risks before they rolled!

### "Thief Skills"

**However**, certain characters (Thieves, Specialists, etc) get very specific skills written down on their character sheets. The general approach to these skills is to only require them to be rolled against when the situation seems otherwise impossible, when the odds are visibly and obviously stacked against them. Each Thief skill has built into it the assumption that something really bad might happen if it fails. If you're not willing to make that bad thing happen, then what's the point of making the thief roll in the first place?

### Other Skills (Proficiencies, etc)

If your flavor of game has skill proficiencies built into it for all characters, the assumption here is that simply *having* the skill in the first place means that you can just do it most of the time, no roll needed. You would only need to roll for those skills when you wanted or needed to do something truly spectacular with them.


## MOVING ONWARD! (The Explore Action)

Each Dungeon Die or Card represents one room of the Dungeon. There will likely be many rooms, and multiple levels of them! Each room can contain numerous horrible dangers, but also a good chance at wondrous loot as well!

In order to continue exploring the Dungeon, your party leader must tell the DM that your group is moving on to the next Room - be sure to discuss tactics and approaches before you move! Moving to the next room in this fashion initiates the **Explore Action** and tells the DM that it's time to roll the dungeon die and the Divining Pool. The rules for divining the Explore Action are in the DM section of this document (further above).


## FIGHTING THINGS! (Combat Rounds)

Combat flows as normal for the base game's rules. HAMMERCRAWL! adds the following new special action(s):

* **Loot Fallen Ally**

### New Personal Action: Loot Fallen Ally

During active combat, a character can take any one readily-accessible item from a fallen ally as an action. Any more in-depth looting must wait until the action is over and the danger clear.

*After* combat, multiple PCs may wish to loot their ally at the same time. Handle this as a special kind initiative. Roll off as usual, and then on their turn a PC may take either one specific item or 1d4 random items.

Money loot from fallen allies is always split evenly among the survivors, unless they otherwise work something else out among themselves.


## CAMPING! (The Camp Action)

The party Leader can choose to take a Camp Action at any time in the dungeon. This requires Light and Rations, however.

**TIME:** 6 Turns (1 hour; light required, unless *entire* party has infravision!)

**REQUIRES:** 1 Ration Each (expended!)

First, **EACH PLAYER PICKS ONE:**

* **Rest:** Recover one rolled hit die per XP level, but also use one additional Ration.
* **Re-Memorize:** Recover one daily spell use per character level.
* **Invest:** Convert one-fourth (rounded up) of their current financial loot value to immediate character XP, discarding the rest. Leveling up requires a separate action, however…
* **Craft Ammo:** Add 2d4 normal arrows for your bow/crossbow, or collect as many stones for your sling.
* **Level up!:** If the hero has enough XP to reach the next level, they can apply the effects of that level as a Camp Action. This adds a Hit Die, as well as any other new-level bonuses. Note that it does not heal existing HP loss or restore used spells or abilities (those are separate Camp Actions, above).
* **Stand Watch:** Add a Green Die to the next room explored, and -1 to GM's camp encounter roll (below).
* **Scout Ahead:** Roll Search (or other system-appropriate check). If successful, add one Yellow die to next 1d4 new rooms explored. If failed, add Black dice instead.

Then, **GM ROLLS 1d6:**

* Subtract 1 for each party member Standing Watch
* Add the current Dungeon Level

If total is 4+, an encounter happens while they camp! Roll as usual to generate a standard encounter. If none of the PCs chose to Stand Watch, then they are also surprised!

If an encounter occurs during camp, the Time and Rations are still spent, and all other chosen Camp Actions still occur. Resolve them before beginning the encounter initiative checks.


## RETURNING HOME! (The Town Action)

When the heroes finally return to town (which likely involves backtracking through the dungeon to their original exit), the following happens, in order:

* Restore HP to Max, and relearn daily Spells and Powers.
* OPTIONAL: Each player can choose to spend any amount of their loot to acquire better goods at the DM's allowance. This could take time, though, so you might want to skip it in Con and One-Shot games. 
* If their loot value is enough to level them up, apply just enough to level them up and discard the rest.
* Apply any effects of character leveling.
* If their loot value is not enough to level them up, apply only half of it as XP and discard the rest – you shouldn’t have left the dungeon so soon!
* Restore their standard starting equipment list to full original capacity.
* Return to the Dungeon!
